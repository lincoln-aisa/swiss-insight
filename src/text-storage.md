In addition, the ban would cover organisations connected to Hamas so that they cannot be used as cover for the group. Groups acting on Hamas’ orders would also be included. The Federal Council did not set out any potential criminal penalties for those found participating in or supporting the group as penalties are already set out in the penal code in relation to participation and support of criminal and terrorist organisations. These include prison sentences of up to 20 years. Any ban would be subject to a potential appeal via Switzerland’s Federal Administrative Tribunal.

      "title": "FILM: TATAMI **** an outstanding film",
      "text": "6 September 2024. By Neptune Dear Cinephiles,I was away last week so a few films have piled up, and will be away again next week, but will keep you informed of the exceptional ones. These reviews will necessarily be short. Last week’s releases: LA PRISONNIÈRE DE BORDEAUX *** (vo French) A well-acted, intriguing film about two women who meet while visiting their respective husbands at a prison in Bordeaux. From very different backgrounds, one is a wealthy bourgeoise living in a large home, the other is a working mother struggling to make ends meet. On a kind whim, the elder lady invites the younger one and her two children to come live with her. With the excellent Isabelle Huppert and the talented Hafsia Herzi, the film creates a profound yet light tale of two opposite women sharing a span of their lives. Fascinatingly French. PRISONNIERS DU DESTIN **1/2 (vo Persian) This documentary about Iranians and Afghans, both families and single men, who have ended up in Switzerland as refugees, follows their difficult quest for integration into a new environment, often waiting years in limbo. Directed by Mehdi Sahebi, it is a sad look at upended lives. LA BELLE AFFAIRE (Zwei zu Eins) *1/2 (vo German) During the 1990s German reunification, a family in East Germany finds a huge stash of now-worthless East German money and tries to figure out a way to cash it in before it’s too late. Maybe this complicated comedy is relevant and funny to Germans, but the hilarity gets lost in translation. Even their world-star, Sandra Huller (“Anatomy of a Fall”, “Zone of Interest”), can’t save this confused mishmash based on a true event. And this week’s releases: TATAMI **** (vo Persian) Now this is an outstanding film, one that is exceptional in many ways. First, it is extraordinary in that it is co-directed by Guy Nattiv (“Golda”) and Zar Amir Ebrahimi (“Holy Spider”, “Shayda”) – one Israeli, the other Iranian, an almost taboo collaboration. Then, it is a highly political film in that it shows the far-reaching power of the Islamic government over its citizens. And it is a gripping thriller that follows an Iranian female judo master in a World Championship event who is about to reach her dream of a gold medal. But as it looks like she might come up against an Israeli opponent, her government insists she bow out of the competition. And she refuses. Starring Zar Amir (who won best actress award in Cannes for “Holy Spider”) as her coach and Adrienne Mandi as the ambitious judoka, the insidious threats of the government have huge repercussions for all involved. You will be holding your breath throughout. This is a courageous, intense tour de force, not to be missed! À L’ANCIENNE *** (vo French) Finally, a delightful French comedy, especially if you don’t mind a bit of silliness. Which is what comedy is all about, really. What makes this one fun and universal is the theme of winning big in the lottery, something we all have at times wished for. But of course this gets complicated, as the two main characters, old best friends on a small island in Brittany, have not won the big ticket but know who has. Veteran stars Didier Bourdon and Gérard Darmon are a hoot as the culprits who get the whole island in a tizzy. Directed by Hervé Mimran, it’s good for a tender laugh, à la comédie anglaise like “The Full Monty”, “Death at a Funeral”, or the 1998 “Waking Ned Devine”, of which this one is an almost exact copy. REINAS **1/2 (vo Spanish) Here’s a gentle tale of a mother who is seeking a better life for her two daughters by emigrating to the U.S. from her native Peru. But there is her large family and her good-for-nothing husband, who was never around but shows up now that she wants to leave, and renews his ties with his daughters – his ‘reinas’. It’s touching and very human, especially that it’s somewhat the story of the director herself, Klaudia Reynicke.

      "title": "Push for federal cuts faces revolt from cantons",
      "text": "Switzerland’s federal government is spending more money than it collects in taxes. This week, a federal commission set out options for spending cuts, reported SRF. The problem is than some of them would involve less federal money going to cantonal governments. Switzerland’s Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter hopes to break the deadlock around balancing the federal budget. To do so, she has called on a group of experts for advice. This week, a group led by Serge Gaillard, a former trade unionist and director of the federal financial administration presented its suggestions. According to the group, taking on more debt is out of the question and something that was not looked at in any detail. It advises instead to focus primarily on cutting spending. The view of the commission broadly in line with Keller-Sutter’s: that the federal government has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. The experts propose cuts in almost all areas that would yield savings of CHF 5 billion. Savings at this level would give the federal government room to manœuvre. Currently, the Federal Council and Parliament have no fiscal room for new projects because of forecast deficits of billions of francs. Suggested areas of saving include spending on climate change mitigation and cutting funding to cantons. Climate subsidies voted in with last years climate protection referendum add up to several billion a year. Climate protection policies should focus more on tax breaks and less on subsidies. This would allow some of the slated spending on subsidies to be clawed back. The group also advises providing less money to the cantons. They should receive less and bear more of their own costs. Subsidising childcare should be funded by cantons, not the federal government. Shifting more of the financial burden of this onto the cantons could save CHF 1.5 billion annually, estimates the commission. Another area of suggested savings is agricultural payments. Switzerland has one of the world’s most heavily supported farming sectors. Small cuts here could add up to big savings. The challenge comes when such bills reach the Council of States, Switzerland’s upper house. The Council of States in made up of two representatives from each canton (one from half cantons). Cantonal representatives are generally against laws that penalise cantons. Although the Finance Minister wants to act urgently on the matter, it is likely that little will happen when cantonal governments lean on their representatives in the Council of States.

      "text": "To run a referendum in Switzerland, vote organisers must first collect a minimum number of signatures from qualified voters. Not all are deemed valid. This week, Switzerland’s federal parliament said it would like a formal investigation into false signatures, in particular those collected by companies paid to collect them for the organisers of referenda, reported RTS. Earlier this week, allegations surfaced that companies collecting signatures on behalf of vote organisaers had falsified some of them, reported Tamedia. In response, the Federal Chancellery said that no vote had taken place as a result of false signatures. However, it also said that it had seen a striking rise in the number of cases in 2022 and a rising number since then. In addition, it said that the suspicious signatures were found mainly among those collected in French-speaking Switzerland. However, it also said it had seen the number emanating from German-speaking Switzerland rising since last winter. The investigation is to be aimed at clarifying where problems lie and to establish whether the companies paid to collect signatures have operated illegally. Systems exist to check the veracity and eligibility of signatures at both municipal and federal levels. The Federal Chancellery verifies these signatures. Part of the investigation will be aimed at ensuring these processes are effective.

      "title": "Switzerland falls short of electric mobility objectives",
      "text": "This week, Switzerland’s federal government met with leaders in the electric mobility sector to discuss progress and set targets for 2030, reported RTS. It appears targets set for 2025 are unlikely to be reached. The last time targets were set they were aimed at 50% of new vehicle registrations being electric by 2025. However, with only a few months left before 2025 begins electric vehicles make up only 27% of total new registrations. David Raedler, co-head of the Transport and Environment Association (ATE), an organisation campaigning against motorway expansion and for lower noise, speed and pollution limits, said he thinks that the private sector will not achieve the targets set without help from the government. Thomas Rücker, the head of Auto Swiss, an association representing Switzerland’s car importers, thinks electricity companies are holding back the adoption of electric vehicles. He thinks the cost of public charging is prohibitive. Charging an electric vehicle on a public charge point can cost two to three times the cost of charging at home. It’s too expensive. Charge point company Ionity charges a whopping CHF 0.79 per kWh in Switzerland, a price far above the roughly CHF 0.30 per kWh most pay at home. A lack of affordable public charge points may make potential electric vehicle buyers think twice before making the switch. Others may decide to buy an electric vehicle for short trips within range of their home charging point and a regular car for long journeys. In addition, some argue there are not enough public charge points. The target of 20,000 by 2025 will fall short by 6,000. Of the roughly 14,000 public charge points available, only around 2,500 offer rapid charging, according to TCS.
